# Hi, I'm Pol
I'm a cybersecurity researcher and software engineer based in Switzerland. 

# What I Do
I work as a researcher at the Cyber Defence Campus (CYD Campus), part of armasuisse, Switzerland's federal agency for defense and technology.

One of my main areas of interest is Encrypted Traffic Analysis (ETA). My work includes:

- Creating realistic encrypted network traffic datasets
- Capturing and processing data using high-speed network cards
- Writing low-level code with the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) for efficient packet handling
- Developing machine learning models for real-time traffic classification
- Building the entire solution with performance-critical C/C++ and CUDA to handle massive network speeds
- Leveraging tools like nix for reproducibility


# Outside of Work
When I'm not diving into code or security research, I love exploring the Swiss outdoors. Whether it's cycling or skiing, the mountains here are my playground.

I also enjoy tinkering with my home server setup, experimenting with self-hosted services, and trying out new tech projects in my free time.
